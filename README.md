**_What is ReelMarkets?_**

ReelMarkets is a mobile game developed in Android Studio that allows users to bet on outcomes of their favorite television shows through user-generated polls. The idea was influenced by the research of prediction markets. In prediction markets, event outcomes are traded (e.g. sports or politics) and used to gauge what populations believe event probability to be. The results are in turn compared with the true outcome of the event. In ReelMarkets, the true outcome of events are scripted therefore the goal is to study whether predictions markets are still viable when outcomes are predetermined.
